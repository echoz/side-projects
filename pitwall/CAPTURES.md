# Pitwall capture provenance

Detailed evidence and refresh guidance for the public Pitwall page.
Paths below are relative to the repository root.

## Pitwall terminal capture

`pitwall/tui-capture.svg` is a faithful terminal-cell rendering of the actual
running Chio TUI, captured at 110 columns by 38 rows on October 7, 2026. Its plain
text equivalent is `pitwall/tui-capture.txt`. The real local daemon received a
synthetic sample with heart rate 145 bpm, speed 3.0 m/s and rich activity context,
including cadence, power, distance, timer, last observed callbacks and source
diagnostics. The measurement overview is preserved alongside six additional
context views: activity summary/profile, navigation, pressure, effort, swimming
and cycling. The TUI read it through
the authenticated server-pushed client path using `tui --live`. The visible
device/session/epoch identities and GPS coordinates are synthetic. This capture
demonstrates the server and client; it bypasses the Garmin simulator. In the
interactive TUI, `n`/`p` changes context, `j`/`k` changes field page, and `o`
returns to the overview.

The SVG preserves the captured ANSI colors, cell positions, borders, and visible
text. It embeds glyph outlines and has no external resources. It is a fixed
recording, not an interactive web terminal. Refresh captures from the running
client; do not invent output or substitute real workout data. Never publish raw
capture logs, provisioning state, credentials, or private source files.

Pitwall's intended physical path requires a paired phone as the Internet bridge;
Garmin describes that mechanism in its [Communications API documentation](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/Communications.html).
The current project targets a Forerunner 970 and iPhone. The rich synthetic
Garmin path passed a five-minute polling run with 276 accepted samples,
22 exactly reported overwrites and 21,280 sampled free bytes at its minimum.
An adversarial pushed-client run also passed: 278 samples, 22 overwrites, a
6,703-byte largest body and 17,488 sampled free bytes.
The immutable ring retains four waiting observations and two frozen for retry;
full batches upload early without reducing collection cadence. This is sampled
production-simulator memory evidence, not a measurement of native encoder peak
allocation or physical-watch memory/battery. SDK 9.2 simulator encoding rounds
the extreme floating-point fixture and needs a string-escaping adapter; physical
phone encoding is unverified. The page must keep the phone requirement, possible
delays, and physical-delivery/HTTPS limitations prominent.

The added contexts preserve the source observations: summary averages/maxima,
calories, start time/location and a losslessly represented activity profile
identifier; navigation bearings, course deviation and destinations; distinct
ambient/raw/sea-level pressure; oxygen saturation, estimated energy expenditure
and aerobic Training Effect; previous swimming interval/length; and observed
front/rear cycling gears. Readings depend on the activity, navigation, device and
sensors. A gear observation does not prove sensor connectivity, and a previous
swimming length does not describe the current stroke. These are sampled facts,
not a complete event history or native workout-plan alignment.

## Pitwall Garmin data-field captures

`pitwall/transponder-large.png`, `pitwall/transponder-half.png`, and
`pitwall/transponder-compact.png` are actual Forerunner 970 simulator screen
captures from October 6, 2026, using Garmin Connect IQ SDK 9.2. They were saved
directly with Garmin’s **File → Save Screen Capture** at 454 × 454 pixels, without
image editing.

The production verification run supplied three fixed synthetic observations
through normal Transponder collection and upload handling. The final observation
was 145 bpm / 3.0 m/s. The same run verified frozen retry after the first durable
acknowledgment was replaced with HTTP 503; these screen captures show the running
renderer and are not separate transport tests. Phone delivery and physical-watch
behavior remain unverified.

The large field uses a red heart for heart rate and blue speedometer for speed,
with units and upload diagnostics. Smaller fields use symbols, numeric counts
and ages; `SIM` is their only word. A blue arrow means sending, amber circular
arrow means retry, red octagon means stopped, and green check plus age means an
earlier accepted upload. A neutral circle means idle; a clock plus `--` means no
ACK. The tray counts queued/in-flight samples. Crossed downward arrow and circled
cross mark dropped and rejected samples. A square/minus marks a collection limit,
barred upward arrow a delivery limit, and warning triangle a setup/reload notice.

The simulator repeats Transponder in every native field slot; visible duplicates
and cyan layout dividers belong to that simulator page. ACK age is historical,
not current connectivity. It differs between captures because the screens were
saved sequentially.

Refresh these PNGs from the actual Garmin simulator during a production run using
synthetic telemetry, preserving the native square screens. Do not redraw the
watch UI, invent captures, or publish real workout data or provisioning state.
